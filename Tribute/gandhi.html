          India.
          His parents are not educated but are well off compared to others in their village, which allows them to
          provide
          a good education for their son.</li>
        <br>
        <h5> Gandhi marries Kasturbai Makhanji in an arranged marriage.</h5>
        <li>
          May 1883 &nbsp;&nbsp; - At the age of 13, Gandhi marries 14 year-old Kasturbai Makhanji. Following the customs
          of
          their region, the children are part of an arranged marriage. They will have four children together.
        </li>

          September 4, 1888 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Gandhi begins studies at University College London. He studies Indian law and
          also joins the Vegetarian Society while there. Gandhi avoids eating meat or drinking alcohol throughout his

        </li>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi returns to India to start his career as a lawyer.</b></h5>
        <li>June 1891 &nbsp;&nbsp; - After completing his studies, Gandhi returns to India to start a law practice in
          Bombay. However, too shy to speak up in court, Gandhi's attempts to be a lawyer fail and he accepts various
          other jobs in legal firms.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5><b> Gandhi goes to South Africa to work for a Muslim Indian law firm.</b></h5>
        <li>April 1893 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Gandhi agrees to travel to South Africa to help a Muslim Indian law firm with a
          lawsuit. He is shocked by the racial discrimination he finds there when he learns he is not allowed to travel
          in the first class section of the train. The trip becomes a major turning point for him as he devotes his life
          to the pursuit of equality and justice.</li>
        <br>
        <h5><b> Gandhi decides to stay in South Africa.</b></h5>
        <li>Spring 1894 &nbsp;&nbsp; - The day he is due to return to India, Gandhi learns about a bill that would deny
          Indians the right to vote. With no opposition to it, Gandhi's friends convince him to stay for another month
          to fight the bill. Gandhi ends up staying in South Africa for 20 years.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi publishes "The Green Pamphlet."</b></h5>
        <li>1896 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Gandhi writes a pamphlet about the discrimination Indians face in South Africa. Great
          Britain, which controls South Africa, believes that "The Green Pamphlet" is an anti-government document and
          begins to view Gandhi as a troublemaker
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi is refused entry into South Africa.
          </b></h5>
        <li>December 1896 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Realizing that he is going to be staying in South Africa, Gandhi returns to
          Bombay to get his wife and children so he can bring them to South Africa. When their ship arrives at Port
          Natal in South Africa, a mob of angry white men, angry that he is stirring up trouble among the Indians,
          refuse to let Gandhi's family into the country. A local police superintendent helps Gandhi and his family
          leave the ship safely and he refuses to press charges on the mob.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi asks the Indian community of South African to refuse to comply with the Transvaal Asiatic
            Registration Act.</b></h5>
        <li>September 1906 &nbsp;&nbsp; - When the Transvaal government announces that all Indians must register and
          produce identification on demand or risk deportation, Gandhi asks Indians to peacefully resist. The Indians
          agree, setting off seven years of protest and struggle between the Indians and government.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi is arrested for the first time.
          </b></h5>
        <li>January 1908 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Among the first to see the court magistrate for his refusal to register with the
          government in South Africa, Gandhi is arrested and spends all of his time in prison reading. When he is
          arrested later that year, he reads "Civil Disobedience" by Henry David Thoreau and is even more committed to
          peaceful resistance.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b> Gandhi is given the title Mahatma.
          </b></h5>
        <li>1913 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Rabindranath Tagore, and Indian poet and Nobel Laureate, refers to Gandhi for the first
          time as Mahatma. The title means "Great Soul" and is given by Hindus to only the holiest men. Gandhi is not
          fond of it because he believes all souls are equal.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi publishes the Declaration of Independence of India.</b></h5>
        <li>January 26, 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Having returned to India as a hero in 1915, Gandhi leads the movement to break
          away from Great Britain. He publishes the Declaration of Independence of India, representing the Indian
          National Congress, and makes his case for Indian independence.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b> Gandhi leads the Salt March in India.</b></h5>
        <li>March 1930 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Forced to buy salt only from Britain, Gandhi protests the monopoly by leading the
          Salt March from Sabermanti to the Arabian Sea, 240 miles away. Gandhi led tens of thousands of people by the
          time they reached the sea, where they defied the law by making their own salt. Protests break out all across
          India and 60,000 are arrested, including Gandhi.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b>Great Britain grants India and Pakistan their independence.
          </b></h5>
        <li>August 15, 1947 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Calling it the "noblest act of the British nation," Gandhi celebrates India's
          independence from England. Unfortunately, the celebration does not last when hundreds of thousands of people
          die as the result of violence between the Muslims of Pakistan and the Hindus of India.
        </li><br>
        <h5><b>Gandhi is assassinated in New Delhi.</b></h5>
        <li>January 30, 1948 &nbsp;&nbsp; - Gandhi is approached by Nathuram Vinayuk Godse, a Hindu nationalist. Gandhi
          blesses him and the man then shoots and kills him for being too sympathetic to the Muslims. Godse is wrong in
          his belief that killing Gandhi will lead to war that will eliminate Muslims. Instead, mourning over Gandhi's
          death leads to peace.
